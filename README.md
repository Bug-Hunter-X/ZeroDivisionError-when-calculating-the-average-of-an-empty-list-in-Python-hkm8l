This repository contains a simple Python function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The original version had a flaw that caused a ZeroDivisionError when an empty list was passed as input. The updated version includes a check to handle this edge case gracefully.

The `bug.py` file contains the code with the error, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.
